#My pseudocode:
#This code will take contig IDs from an expression matrix and fetch annotation from the annotation file(txt/csv):
# 1. Parse an annotation table:
#     extract the 2 first columns
#     use "^" to separate text in the 2nd column into the separate columns 
# Create a dictionary with IDs as keys and annotations as values?
# 2. Load an expression matrix:
#      Take a single contig ID from the 1st column
#      Find a matching ID in the annotation file
#      Transfer the annotation to a new column in the expression matrix

import numpy as np
matrix = np.loadtxt('trinotate_annotation_report_good.Trinity_assembly_0.95.txt')
