#My pseudocode:
#This code will take contig IDs from an expression matrix and fetch annotation from the annotation file(txt/csv):
1) Parse an annotation table:
    read the file line by line
2) store the data in dictionary with ID (column1) as a key and decription (column 2) as a value
3) parse the column 2 for gene ID and annotation
    use "^" as a separator 

4) Load an expression matrix:
    Read the file line by line
5) If ID in column 1 is found in annotation table column 1
6) Print annotation as 2nd column

import numpy as np
matrix = np.loadtxt('trinotate_annotation_report_good.Trinity_assembly_0.95.txt')
